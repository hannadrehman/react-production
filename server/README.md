# NODEJS Application

## info

express application that is used to serve the static client application after building for production.
acts as a proxy server for client app while delopment also. this app should be used for basic auth, routing, session management and serving the client application.
this app includes

1. express, morgan, compression and helmet, http-proxy-middleware
2. eslint
3. customizable build config
4. unit test cases with jest
5. es2017

**this project requires**

1. `NodeJS`
2. `npm`.

## How to set up ? Install.

this app is a simple HTTP static web server which is going to server front end application when running in production.
it will mainly be used to return static files and do simple authentication.

install node modules and run server application

- hit `npm install`
- use `vs code` for best developer experience.
- download `EditorConfig for VS Code`
- download `EsLint` for vs code
- download `Prettier - code formatter` for vs code.
- you try other code editors also. as long as they support the above mentioned pluguns.

### start

after installing all modules hit `npm start`
this will run the applications in `watch` mode. meaning any file change will be reacted and updated
in the browser.

### build

to build for deployment/production.

- hit `npm run build`

doing this will create a `dist` folder in the application root which will contain a built
`nodejs` application redy to deploy with its own `package.json` install node modules and run the app.

### Unit Testing

we are using jets unit testing javascript. you can write unit test cases for
each javascript module (in ES6, commonJS a module is simply a javascript file .js ). to test any module just create
the same filename with .`spec.js`  at the end. for example `api.service.js` => `api.service.spec.js`

tests can be run in 2 modes.

1. watch mode => where you can make changes to test files and on save all the jest tests will re run.
2. complete mode => where you start the tests and it runs to completion. no file changes are monitored in this mode.

**npm scripts**

- `npm run test:watch` runs the tests in watch mode. it provides some cli options which you can play with
- `npm run test` runs tests without watch mode. these are simplte run to completion tests.

**important**
to run the built application it needs following environment variables

1. `NODE_ENV`='production'
2. `NODE_ENV_PORT`='3000' or any available port

## npm scripts.

```
 "scripts": {
  "start": "export NODE_ENV=development&& export NODE_ENV_PORT=3000&& npm run start:lint",   # start the application with lint and env variables.
  "start:lint": "nodemon ./src/index.js --exec 'npm run lint && node' ",                     # start node app with eslint.
  "start:no-lint": "nodemon ./src/index.js",                                                 # start project with no eslint (not recommended).
  "build": "npm run test && node build.js",                                                  # build the app, first runs the test and starts build config.
  "test:watch": "npm run test -- --watchAll",                                                # runs test runner in watch mode.
  "test": "jest",                                                                            # starts jest test runner
  "lint": "esw ./src/"                                                                       # starts eslint on src
},
```

## under the hood

- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)
- [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/)
- [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware)

## recommendations

its best to use vs code with the following plugins installed.

1. EditorConfig for VS Code
2. EsLint
3. Prettier - code formatter
