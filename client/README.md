# React Application

## info

a complete projet for react production grade project with :

1. react, redux , redux sagas
2. eslint
3. customizable build config
4. jest and enzyme test framework
5. babel and eslint config to support es2017
6. react hot module replacement
7. code spliting
8. code organisation based on "Feature first approach"
9. webpack 4.

**this project requires**

1. `NodeJS`
2. `npm`.
3. `python 2.7` which may change in future

## How to set up? Install

this app is where all front end code will live. in most of the cases it will be a single page application
build with react,redux,sagas, and build by webpack.

- install node modules and run client applicarion
- hit `npm install`
- use `vs code` for best developer experience.
- download `EditorConfig for VS Code`
- download `EsLint` for vs code
- download `Prettier - code formatter` for vs code.
- you try other code editors also. as long as they support the above mentioned pluguns.

### start

after installing all modules hit `npm start`
this will run the applications in `watch` mode. meaning any file change will be reacted and updated
in the browser. (Hot module replacement)

### build

to build for deployment/production.

- hit `npm run build`

doing this will copy build diles to dist folder in root `dist/public` folder in the application root which will contain a full stack build
`nodejs` application redy to deploy with its own `package.json` install node modules and run the app.

**important**
to run the built application it needs following environment variables

1. `NODE_ENV`='production'
2. `NODE_ENV_PORT`='3000' or any available port
