# React FullStack

## info
  a complete projet for react production grade project with :
  1. react, redux , redux sagas
  2. eslint
  3. customizable build config
  4. jest and enzyme test framework
  5. babel and eslint config to support es2017
  6. react hot module replacement
  7. code spliting
  8. code organisation based on "Feature first approach"
  9. expressJs as a web server for serving static files. 
  10. a simple starter kit for express nodejs app with proxy, lint, and configuration based on ENV variables.
  11. webpack 4.

**this project requires** 

  1. `NodeJS`
  2. `npm`.
  3. `python 2.7` which may change in future

## How to set up?
React full stack has 2 main applications. 
  1. Client 
  2. Server

### Client
  Client is where all front end code will live. in most of the cases it will be a single page application 
  build with react,redux,sagas, and build by webpack.

### Server
  Server is a simple HTTP static web server which is going to server front end application when running in production. it will mainly be used to return static files and do simple authentication to prevent first render

### Install
  to install and run this project you need to 
  1. install node modules and run client applicarion 
  2. install node modules and run  server application

   `cd client` and hit `npm install`

   `cd server` and hit `npm install`

### start
  after installing all modules hit `npm start` in both `client` and `server` folders
  this will run both the applications in `watch` mode. meaning any file change will be reacted and updated 
  in the browser.

### build
  to build for deployment/production.
  1. go to server folder and hit `npm run build`
  2. wait for server build to finish 
  3. go to client folder and hit `npm run build`

  doing this will create a `dist` folder in the application root which will contain a full stack build
  `nodejs` application redy to deploy with its own `package.json` install node modules and run the app.

**important**
  to run the built application it needs following environment variables
  1. `NODE_ENV`='production'
  2. `NODE_ENV_PORT`='3000' or any available port

## recommendations
  its best to use vs code with the following plugins installed.
  1. EditorConfig for VS Code
  2. EsLint
  3. Prettier - code formatter
